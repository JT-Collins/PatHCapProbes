This package contains the R function for creating hybrid capture probes.

The main function can be called such as:

probeGen(fasta_file, gff_file, probes_file, add_apt = FALSE, pre_str = "", suf_str = "") 

where fasta_file contains the bacterial genome sequence.
gff_file contains the bacterial genome/transcriptome annotation in gff format.
probes_file is the path to the output file that contains the sequence of generated probes.

There are three optional parameters to this function,
add_apt is used to indicate if adapter would be added to the pre and post of the generated probes.
pre_str and suf_str are sequence of prefix and suffix adapters.
